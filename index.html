<h1>Rome</h1>
<p>I first visited Rome in Graduate school. I spent 2 weeks there
    learning about architecture, philosophy, and the intricacies
    of public transportation in a major European city (no small feat!)
</p>
<h1>Rome - take 2</h1>
<p>After my wedding, my wife and I visited Rome for a few days
    for vacation. I spent the 4 days showing my wife all my favorite
    places from the last time I visited.
</p>
<h1>London</h1>
<p>A couple years later, we visited London. We spent hours riding
    the tube to the various tourist spots, including Greenwich Market,
    Buckingham Palace, and Kensington Gardens.
</p>
<h1>New York</h1>
<p>Again, after a few years, we took off to the Big Apple to immerse
    ourselves in Broadway shows, and all the touristy things you can do
    in New York. The biggest highlight of the trip? We won the lottery to
    see <strong><em>Hamilton!</em></strong>
