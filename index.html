        In the past few years, I've taken on an interest in Broadway and musical theater.

        What follows is a list of a few of my favorite Broadway shows.

    <p>
        In 2016, my wife and I visited New York City on vacation. Upon arrival, we began entering
        the lottery to see <em>Hamilton</em>, which was (and is, as of this writing), the hottest show
        on Broadway - a hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton, one of America's Founding Fathers.

    <p>
        On our second day in the city, we won!

    <h1>Waitress</h1>

    <p>Music and Lyrics by Sarah Barreiles, and based on the movie by the same name. The movie
        starred Kerri Russel, but the musical starred Jessie Mueller, who previously won a Tony
        for playing Carol King in <em>Beautiful</em>.

    <h1>Something Rotten</h1>

    <p>
        <em>Something Rotten</em> is a comedy musical starring Brian D'Arcy James and Christian Borle. It's
        a hilarious comedy about the (fictional) creation of the first ever musical, that pokes fun at
        all the musical tropes we all know and love - dance breaks, randomly breaking into song, and the
        strangely acceptable all-sung shows like <em>Les Miserables</em>.
