        In the past few years, I've taken on an interest in Broadway and musical theater.

        What follows is a list of a few of my favorite Broadway shows.

        <h2>Hamilton</h2>

        <p>
            In 2016, my wife and I visited New York City on vacation. Upon arrival, we began entering
            the lottery to see <em>Hamilton</em>, which was (and is, as of this writing), the hottest show
            on Broadway - a hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton, one of America's Founding Fathers.
        </p>
        <p>
            On our second day in the city, we won!
        </p>
        <p>
            We had to cancel our tickets to see The King & I, but it was very much worth it, to get front-row
            tickets to the most popular show on Broadway for only $20.

            Music and Lyrics by Sarah Barreiles, and based on the movie by the same name. The movie
            starred Kerri Russel, but the musical starred Jessie Mueller, who previously won a Tony
            for playing Carol King in <em>Beautiful</em>.

            <em>Something Rotten</em> is a comedy musical starring Brian D'Arcy James and Christian Borle. It's
            a hilarious comedy about the (fictional) creation of the first ever musical, that pokes fun at
            all the musical tropes we all know and love - dance breaks, randomly breaking into song, and the
            strangely acceptable all-sung shows like <em>Les Miserables</em>.
