    <h1>It's... a... musical!</h1>
    <p>
        In the past few years, I've taken on an interest in Broadway and musical theater.
        In 2016 my wife and I visited New York and saw a few shows between stops at all
        the usual tourist attractions.

            <strong>Hamilton</strong> was (and still is, as of this writing) the hottest Broadway sensation of 2016.
            Tickets are next to impossible to get, and ridiculously expensive. Daily, however, there is a lottery that
            fans can sign up for to get front row seats for $10 each. As luck would have it, we won, and saw what has
            become - for me - my absolute favorite musical.

            We had to cancel our tickets to see The King &amp; I, but it was very much worth it, to get front-row
            tickets to the most popular show on Broadway for only $20!

            Music and Lyrics by Sara Bareilles, and based on the movie by the same name. The movie
            starred Kerri Russel, but the musical starred Jessie Mueller, who previously won a Tony
            for playing Carol King in <em>Beautiful</em>.

            <em>Something Rotten</em> is a comedy musical starring Brian D'Arcy James and Christian Borle. It's
            a hilarious comedy about the (fictional) creation of the first ever musical, that pokes fun at
            all the musical tropes we all know and love - dance breaks, randomly breaking into song, and the
            strangely acceptable all-sung shows like <em>Les Miserables</em>.

            Normally, one would jump at the opportunity to see Audra McDonald live on Broadway. We were no exception
            to this rule. Problem being: while Audra was great, this show was <em>horrrrible</em>. Shortly after we saw it,
            it closed. I don't think anyone is particularly bothered.
